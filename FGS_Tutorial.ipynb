    "The Kepler spacecraft uses Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) to keep the pointing of the telescope fixed. There are 4 small sensors in the corner of the focal plane. The sensors use guide stars which are chosen based on being bright and with low variability. These stars are measured very rapidly using a short exposure (104ms) with a variable time sampling. Measurements are taken on average every 30 seconds, with some observations being taken on even shorter time frames. The full documentation on the FGS data can be found [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/fgs_doc_KSCI-19112.pdf)."
